# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
A Machine Learning enthusiast with experience in two internships, research papers and self-projects. Deep Learning
has interested me so I have invested my time in building my concepts from neural networks to how
to execute and understand Deep Learning Architectures in both CNN and NLP. I plan to pursue a
masters in Computer Science to gain knowledge and skill sets to attain jobs in this field.


## Research interests

1. **AI in Medical Imaging** - image segmentation and classification using deep learning and computer vision are important steps for detection and idnetification of medical images to come to a conclusion. I have recently written a paper - "The Current Developments as well as Long-Term Prospects for Deep Learning across Biomedical Applications". this paper discusses the bio-imaging of DNA, proteins, calles and tisuues. My self projects include detection and detection of lung cancer. 
After these multiple projects using 2d images, medical imaging is being done using **3D or 4D images**. Also for tackling class imbalance in cases of binary classification, we can use **dice entropy** loss fucntion. I am currently working to observe and come to a conclusion of which Loss Function such as Generalized Dice Loss, Focal Loss, Tversky loss and Unified Focal Loss work better for different datasets.

2. **DL-controlled Autonomous driving**
4. **DeepFake**
5. **Women In Engineering**
6. **Dark Matter in AI**
