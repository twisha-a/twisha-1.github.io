# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
A Machine Learning enthusiast with experience in two internships, research papers and self-projects. Deep Learning
has interested me so I have invested my time in building my concepts from neural networks to how
to execute and understand Deep Learning Architectures in both CNN and NLP. I plan to pursue a
masters in Computer Science to gain knowledge and skill sets to attain jobs in this field.


## Research interests

1. **AI in Medical Imaging** - image segmentation and classification is an important step for detection and idnetification of medical images. I have recently written a paper - "The Current Developments as well as Long-Term Prospects for Deep Learning across Biomedical Applications". this paper discusses the bio-imaging of DNA, proteins, calles and tisuues.

2. **DL-controlled Autonomous driving**
4. **DeepFake**
5. **Women In Engineering**
6. **Dark Matter in AI**
